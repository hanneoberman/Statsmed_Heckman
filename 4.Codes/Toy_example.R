# variable is a binary variable, it should specified as factor variable with 2 levels.

#Furthermore, in the prediction matrix, the group or cluster variable should be specified as "-2", all predictor variables
#belonging to the selection and outcome as "1", the exclusion restrictions or predictor variables that are only included in the selection equation 
#as "-3" and those that are only included in the outcome equation as "-4".
pred <- ini$predictorMatrix
pred[,"Cluster"] <- -2 # Cluster variable
pred["Weight","Time"]  <- -3 # Exclusion restriction

# Imputation of weight variable with (predictive mean matching) pmm: we can also use the ppm approach, by setting pmm= TRUE and providing a vector of donnors ypmm,
# for instance in this case the vector or donnors are weight from 25 to 200 kilograms and the imputed values are given in this range of values.
