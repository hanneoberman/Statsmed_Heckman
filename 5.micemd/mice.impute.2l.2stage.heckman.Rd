\title{
Imputation based on Heckman model for multilevel data.
}
\description{
Imputes outcome and predictor variables that follow an MNAR mechanism according to Heckman's model and come from a multilevel database such as individual participant data with systematically and sporadically missing values.
}
\usage{
mice.impute.2l.2stage.heckman <-function(y,ry,x,wy = NULL, type, pmm = FALSE, ypmm=NULL, meta_method ="reml",...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{y}{
Vector to be imputed
}
  \item{ry}{
Logical vector of length \code{length(y)} indicating the subset \code{y[ry]} of elements in \code{y} to which the imputation model is fitted. The \code{ry} generally distinguishes the observed (\code{TRUE}) and missing values (\code{FALSE}) in \code{y}.
}
  \item{x}{
Numeric design matrix with \code{length(y)} rows with predictors for \code{y}. Matrix \code{x} may have no missing values.
}
  \item{wy}{
Logical vector of length \code{length(y)}. A \code{TRUE} value indicates locations in \code{y} for which imputations are created.
}
  \item{type}{
  Type of the variable in the prediction model {0: No predictor,
 1: Predictor in both the outcome and selection,-2: Cluster id (study id), -3: Predictor only in the selection model, -4: Predictor only in the outcome model.}
}
  \item{pmm}{
Predictive mean matching can be applied only for missing continuous variables: "TRUE","FALSE".
}
  \item{ypmm}{
Continuous vector of donor values of y to perform the predictive mean matching, in case ypmm is not provided, the observable values of y are used.
}
  \item{meta_method}{
Meta_analysis estimation method for random effects: "ml" (maximum likelihood), "reml" (restricted maximum likelihood) or "mm" method of moments.
}
  \item{\dots}{
Other named arguments. Not used.
}
}
\details{
Imputes systematically and sporadically missing binary and continuous univariate variables that follow a MNAR mechanism according to the Heckman selection model and come from a clustered dataset. The imputation method uses a two-stage approach in which the Heckman model parameters at the cluster level are estimated using the copula method.
}
\value{
Vector with imputed data, of type binary or continuous
}

\note{
Missing binary variables should be included as two-level factor type variables in the incomplete dataset.Cluster variable should be included as numeric variable in the dataset, and defined as -2 in the predictor matrix. When the cluster variable is not specified, the imputation method is based on a simple Heckman model, i.e. without taking into account the hierarchical structure. In case the Heckman model cannot be estimated at the study level, the imputation method will be based on the simple Heckman model.

\examples{
data(dataObs, package = "micemd") # load and subset dataset
ini <- mice(dataObs, maxit = 0)
# define imputation methods for each incomplete variables
meth <- ini$method 
meth[c("Age","Height","Weight")] <- "2l.2stage.norm" 
meth[c("FAVC")] <- "2l.2stage.bin" 
meth["Weight"] <- "2l.2stage.heckman" 
# set type of predictor variable, here Weight variable is assumed an MNAR variable
pred <-ini$predictorMatrix
pred[,"Cluster"] <- -2 # Cluster variable
pred["Weight","Time"]  <- -3 # Variable only affects the selection model (Exclusion restriction)
pred["Weight",c("Height","FAVC")]  <- -4 # Variables only affect the outcome model
# As Age and Gender are predictors in both selection and outcome model are set as 1
imp <- mice(data = dataObs, meth = meth, pred = pred, seed = 123) # imputation continuos variable
imp_pmm <- mice(data = dataObs, meth = meth, pred = pred,pmm=TRUE, ypmm=seq(35,180,0.1), seed = 123) #imputation with pmm
#Summary weight

(summary(complete(imp_pmm,"long")$Weight))
#Model weight
